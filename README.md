App Challenge

First commit

Initial configuration: Added App Icon to Assets, new image "Logo" and updated color "AccentColor". Configure LaunchScreen and AppDelegate. Changed initial flow navigation screen with programatically flow navigation from AppDelegate.

Deleted files that will not be used during this challenge: Main.storyboard and SceneDelegate.swift.

Folder hierarchy created. Structured in the following points:

- Configuration: Files that build the initial base of the project.
- Database: Files that compose the local database of the project.
- Resources: Useful files such as fonts, images, etc.
- Modules: Main section of the application that contains the files that represent the screens, data management, navigation flow, etc.
